Python code for estimating 3DMM parameters using **[our very deep neural network](http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/CNN3DMM)**
===========

This page contains end-to-end demo code that estimates the 3D facial shape and texture directly from an unconstrained 2D face image. For a given input image, it produces a standard ply file of the face shape and texture. It accompanies the deep network described in our paper [1].

This release is part of an on-going face recognition and modeling project. Please, see **[this page](http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/CNN3DMM)** for updates and more data.

**A new version of this code which includes also pose and expression fitting, is being prepared and will be released soon.**

## Features
* **End-to-End code** to be used for **3D shape and texture estimation** directly from image intensities
* Designed and tested on **face images in unconstrained conditions**, including the challenging LFW, YTF and IJB-A benchmarks
* The 3D face shape and texture parameters extracted using our network were **shown for the first time to be descriminative and robust**, providing near state of the art face recognition performance with 3DMM representations on these benchmarks
* **No expensive, iterative optimization, inner loops** to regress the shape. 3DMM fitting is therefore extremely fast

## Dependencies

## Library requirements

* [Dlib Python Wrapper](http://dlib.net/)
* [OpenCV Python Wrapper](http://opencv.org/)
* [Caffe](caffe.berkeleyvision.org) (**version 1.0.0-rc3 or above required**)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Python2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

The code has been tested on Linux only. On Linux you can rely on the default version of python, installing all the packages needed from the package manager or on Anaconda Python and install required packages through `conda`. A bit more effort is required to install caff√©.

## Data requirements

Before running the code, please, make sure to have all the required data in the following specific folder:
- **[Download our CNN](http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/CNN3DMM)**
- **[Download the Basel Face Model](http://faces.cs.unibas.ch/bfm/main.php?nav=1-2&id=downloads)** 
- **[Download dlib face prediction model](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)** and move the `.dat` file into the `dlib_model` folder.
- Move the CNN model (3 files: `3dmm_cnn_resnet_101.caffemodel`,`deploy_network.prototxt`,`mean.binaryproto`) into the `CNN` folder
- Copy  the Basel Face Model (`01_MorphableModel.mat`) in the same folder of `demo.py` file.
- Run the script `python trimBaselFace.py`. This should output a file `BaselFaceModel_mod.mat` and remove the original one automatically.


## Usage

### Input

The demo script can be used from the command line with the following syntax:

```bash
$ Usage: python demo.py <inputList> <outputDir> <needCrop> <useLM>
```

where the parameters are the following:
- `<inputList>` is a text file containing the paths to each of the input images, one in each line.
- `<outputDir>` is the path to the output directory, where ply files are stored.
- `<needCrop>` tells the demo if the images need cropping (1) or not (0). Default 1. If your input image size is equal (square) and has a CASIA-like [2] bounding box, you can set `<needCrop>` as 0. Otherwise, you have to set it as 1.
- `<useLM>` is an option to refine the bounding box using detected landmarks (1) or not (0). Default 1.

Example for `<inputList>`:
<pre>
data/1.jpg
data/2.jpg
....
</pre>

### Output
The demo code should produce an output similar to this:

```bash
user@system:~/Desktop/3dmm_release$ python demo.py input.txt out/
> Prepare image data/1.jpg:
>     Number of faces detected: 1
> Prepare image data/2.jpg:
>     Number of faces detected: 1
> CNN Model loaded to regress 3D Shape and Texture!
> Loaded the Basel Face Model to write the 3D output!
> Processing image:  tmp_ims/2.png   2.png   1/2
> Writing 3D file in:  out//2.ply
> Processing image:  tmp_ims/1.png   1.png   2/2
> Writing 3D file in:  out//1.ply

```

The final 3D shape and texture can be displayed using standard off-the-shelf 3D (ply file) visualization software such as [MeshLab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net). Using MeshLab, the output may be displayed as follows:

`user@system:~/Desktop/3dmm_release$ meshlab out/1.ply`

`user@system:~/Desktop/3dmm_release$ meshlab out/2.ply`

which should produce something similar to:

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Old Caffe Engine ###

```C++
"F0210 10:49:17.604714 24046 net.cpp:797] Check failed:
target_blobs.size() == source_layer.blobs_size() (5 vs. 3) Incompatible
number of blobs for layer bn_conv1"
```

### Solution: install caffe 1.0.0-rc3 or above. ###
For more info on caffe  verson please see https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/releases

To check your caffe version from python:

```python
In [3]: import caffe
In [4]: caffe.__version__
Out[4]: '1.0.0-rc3'
```
